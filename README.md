# what-i-learned-week-4

this week, week 4 (June 8th to 11th, 2020)
we learned about javascript booleans and indices

booleans are options that will lead to either a True result or a False result option, depending on the code i write. when someone means boolean operator, they mean true or false.

### Boolean Operators
- &&  AND
- <== LESS THAN OR EQUAL TO
- >== LESS THAN 
- === EQUAL TO
- ||  OR
- ! NOT


### Indices
indices are defined as a position of  each character in a value.
From left to right we begin counting from '0', 
example: 
'Daniel' contains six(6) index positions. beginning with "D" counting from zero(0) to whatever singular value is at the end. Spaces, commas, numbers, exclamation marks, etc. are all included. If it takes up space in the script, it can be counted among part of the index.

| value/string/integer      | Index Position | pull index code  |
| :---                      |    :----:      |          ---:    |
| D                         | 0              | name[0]          |
| A                         | 1              | name[1]          |
| N                         | 2              | name[2]          |
| I                         | 3              | name[3]          |
| E                         | 4              | name[4]          |
| L                         | 5              | name[5]          |
